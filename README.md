# Pipper

This is literally just a webview in a window setup to be floating over other apps.

I sometimes like to have a window stay always visible on screen, so I did this.

Use the "Navigate" items in the Menu Bar to type in or paste the URL to visit.

You can also just launch the app from terminal:

    open {link} -a /Applications/Pipper.app
